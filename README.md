# earthAnimation
A WebGL animation I made as part of my Advanced Graphics And Computer Vision unit

## Instructions for opening
Due to default settings on certain browsers (namely chrome, opera and firefox), the textures will not load when running from a local folder (I can confirm that it works perfectly fine when hosted on a virtual server).

So the 2 browsers (that I know work) to use when looking at this project locally is to open index.html is either internet explorer or edge.
